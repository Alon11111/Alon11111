## Hi, I'm Alon Shvartzman, a Full-Stack Python Developer 🐍🌐

🚀 Coding Journey Kickstarted in 2021! 💻

My coding adventure began when I cracked a riddle in an ad, armed with just a hint of programming knowledge. What started as a puzzle-solving hobby evolved into my passion for full-stack Python development.

As a junior developer, I bring a blend of resilience and creativity to the table. I thrive on turning challenges into opportunities and am eager to contribute my problem-solving skills to the dynamic world of full-stack development. Let's code the future together! ✨
